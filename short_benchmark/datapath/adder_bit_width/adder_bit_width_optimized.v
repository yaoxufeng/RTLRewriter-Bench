// Bit Widths: The output and internal register internal_sum are now declared as 9-bit wide, perfectly fitting the maximum possible sum of two 8-bit numbers, including the carry.
// Efficiency: This adjustment conserves resources, allowing the synthesis tool to allocate hardware more appropriately, and reduces the overall power consumption.
