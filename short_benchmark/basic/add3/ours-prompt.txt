Now you are an experienced and skilled Verilog engineer. Your objective is to optimize the given Verilog Code to obtain better synthesis results including area, performance while Ensuring the optimized version retains FUNCTIONAL EQUIVALENCE. 

Here's an optimization example.

</EXAMPLE 1>

Original Code:
```verilog
module example(
    input wire clk,
    input wire reset,
    input wire [1:0] input_signal, // 2-bit input to represent four possible inputs (0-3)
    output reg output_signal
);

    // Define state codes

    // State register
    reg [2:0] current_state, next_state;

    // Output logic based on the current state
    always @(current_state) begin

    always @(*) begin

                // No case for 2'b10 as it leads to S1 itself
            endcase

# Guidelines:
- PAY ATTENTION to sub-expression elimnations.
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes.
- Make a deeper understanding of how each state interacts and transitions based on the input and the impact on the output.
- Carefully check input and output state, ENSURE the optimized version retains FUNCTIONAL EQUIVALENCE with the original while being OPTIMIZED for synthesis.
- You can draw insiprations from provided examples, utilizing its optimization patterns rather than following its code style.
- Make SURE your optimized version is clear and understandable.

Take a Deep Breath and Carefully Follow the Guides I gave you. I will tip you $2000 if you OPTIMIZE the Code Perfectly.
