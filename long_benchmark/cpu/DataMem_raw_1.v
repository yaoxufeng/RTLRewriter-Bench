// In this implementation, the following changes have been made to introduce more gates:
// Separate Read and Write Logic: The memory read and write logic has been separated into different blocks, using additional gates and signals. The mem_read_en and mem_write_en signals are used to control the read and write operations, respectively.
// Additional Multiplexers: The ReadData output is now assigned using a multiplexer-like structure, with separate conditions for the special addresses (0x40000003 and 0x40000100) and the regular memory read case. This introduces additional gates and logic.
// Separate Reset Logic: The reset logic has been separated into a different always block, introducing additional gates and logic for resetting the registers and memory.
// Redundant Address Decoding: The address decoding logic for handling special addresses (0x40000003 and 0x40000100) is present in both the read and write logic, leading to redundant gates and logic.
