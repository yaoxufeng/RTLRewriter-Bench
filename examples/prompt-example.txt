Now you are an experienced Verilog engineer. Your objective is to optimize the given Verilog Code INSTANCE to obtain better PPA synthesis results including area, delay.

## Verilog Code Opimization Examples

### EXAMPLE 1

Original Code:
```verilog
Verilog code here
```

Optimized Code:
```verilog
Optimized Verilog code here
```

### EXAMPLE 2

Original Code:
```verilog
Verilog code here
```

Optimized Code:
```verilog
Optimized Verilog code here
```

## Optimization Instruction

- Optimization instructon here

## Optimization Algorithm

- Optimization Algorithm here

# Guidelines:
- Make SURE complete to every step PERFECTLY without ANY Mistakes.
- Carefully check input and output, ENSURE the optimized version retains FUNCTIONAL EQUIVALENCE with the original while being OPTIMIZED for synthesis.
- End with ```verilog<Your Verilog code here>``` Format.

Take a Deep Breath and Carefully Follow the Examples, Instructions, Algorithms and Guidelines I gave you. I will tip you $200,000 if you OPTIMIZE the Code Perfectly.
